      Jetray is a complex motion control rover that can repeatably position large sensors to scan aircraft for stress points, defects, joint fatigue, crack,
      corrosion and delamination's. Equipped with different sensors, it can either make direct contact with the surface or scan from a distance.

      I worked on a team of 3 developers, where the other two worked on the embedded systems and I was solely responsible for the control application. This
      included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>building an Electron.js app using the Three.js engine for 3D visualization</li>
      <li>real-time viewing/control using web sockets</li>
      <li>a kinematics system</li>
      <li>serial communication to the embedded systems</li>
      <li>3D modeling to convert the CAD models into a usable format</li>
      <li>user authentication & logging system</li>
      <li>integration with a 3rd party to receive collection plans</li>
      <li>designing the UI for our pendant controller</li>
    </ul>

      Over the course of the 3 years that I worked at Alstom, I developed a web interface for our NVSP2 application. This served as a real time diagnostic
      panel to our embedded system. It featured real time logic viewing (pictured), diagnostic conditions, network and communication links viewing, board
      updating and much more. I also worked on backend system software, such as the update manager and the web gateway process that communicated with the
      web interface via tcp sockets and web sockets. Since the web server runs on an embedded system, it needed to be lightweight so I developed a custom
      PHP framework.

      This was the first game I ever created which I gave myself a timeline of 3 months to learn Unity/Maya and make a small game. I use Unity 3D as the
      engine, programming in C# and created all of the 3d assets. I kept track of my progress throughout the entire game which you can view on my projects
      page.
    <p> 
    </p>
      It is a small city builder style game in which you are trying to stop the citizens from being corrupted by evil through various mechanics. It
      sold around 500 copies on Steam.

      Worked in a team of two to develop and migrate the magazine's online site to a Drupal 7 framework to increase productivity and traffic. Developed a
      custom track changes module so that articles could be edited directly on the site without using Microsoft Word or Google Docs outside of the workflow.
      Created the Drupal 7 theme from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developed the Reporter Android app and oversaw the iOS app development. Placed second for our mobile application in the Society of Professional
      Journalists Mark of Excellence Awards.

      Developed and in house tool for tracking the progress of PCB board assembly at Limerock. It can allow anyone in the company to request a PCB board to
      start being assembly and can track the board through etching, kit creation and assembly. Purchase orders can also be added to track the cost of each
      board and files can be uploaded such as the Board Layout, BOM and Gerber Files.

      For my senior design project I worked on a team of three to create an app that can collect metrics on a phones cellular performance. Data that is collected on the phone is uploaded to a web service where it can then be anaylzed. The key aspects that I worked on for this project was our bandwidth test server, the application GUI and data visualization and server maintenance.

      Worked as a contractor for Lime Rock Engineering LLC to develop an Android application to control a leg assistance device. The application connects to the device via Bluetooth, where it can send commands to control the pedals and receives data to show statistics of the user's progress.

      Worked as a contractor for Lime Rock Engineering LLC to develop an Android application to control a grandfather clock. The application connects to the device via Bluetooth, where it then downloads the songs available on the device and allows the user to set the song mode, change the volume, pick a song and more. This app also runs on a phone dedicated to being a remote for the clock, so it was setup in kiosk mode so the user couldnt get out of the application.
